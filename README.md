This report is for the final project for Data Analytics (EEL4774). 
The objective of the project is to experiment and then fine tune various machine learning models to achieve 
the best accuracy on a provided dataset. There were 2 options for the dataset: (Time 
Series, Images). I choose to go with the image classification set. 
The dataset contains roughly 2000 images of formats such as JPEG and PNG. There are 
17 Classes (Adult, Airplane, Alpaca, Bird, Bus, Car, Cat, Child, Elephant, Flower, Giraffe, 
Horse, Monkey, Panda, Reptile, Vessel). Each image is inside a parent folder with its 
respective classes. The images have different sizes and resolutions. 
Due to the non-linear nature of image data, the approach chosen went from using 
models of increasing complexity and sophistication that supported nonlinearity.
